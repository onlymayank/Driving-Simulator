# Driving-Simulator
---
## Overview
Welcome to the Driving Simulator project! This repository is dedicated to the development of a virtual driving simulator, aiming to provide a realistic and immersive experience for users to practice and enhance their driving skills in a simulated environment.
---
## Features
1. **Virtual Environment:** Create a 3D virtual environment that simulates real-world driving scenarios, including streets, intersections, and varying weather conditions.
2. **User Interaction:** Implement user controls to steer, accelerate, brake, and navigate through the simulated environment using a keyboard, joystick, or other input devices.
3. **Realistic Physics:** Incorporate realistic physics and vehicle dynamics to simulate the behavior of a real car, providing users with an authentic driving experience.
4. **Scenarios and Challenges:** Develop different driving scenarios and challenges to help users practice specific skills, such as parking, lane-changing, and handling adverse conditions.
5. **Feedback and Evaluation:** Provide feedback to users on their driving performance and offer evaluations to help them identify areas for improvement.
6. **User Interface:** Design an intuitive user interface that displays relevant information, such as speed, fuel level, and navigation details.
